# Local development SQL protocol

This compatibility adapter is explicitly selected with --protocol dev-tsv. The native CLI and Docker default to the official JSONL protocol published in upstream f4d4e26653af823a7601668802f80e374ad6643c. See the JSONL notes below.

## Launch

minivectordb --protocol dev-tsv --data-dir /data --sort-memory 8388608

The database is /data/database.mvdb and sort runs are under /data/tmp. The sort option is a byte budget for sort state, not a total process-memory limit. Minimum CLI value: 4096 bytes. The current parser materializes one SQL statement, with a CLI limit of 16 MiB.

Input is UTF-8 SQL on stdin. Semicolons separate statements outside single-quoted strings, backtick identifiers, -- line comments and /* block comments */. Doubled quote/backtick characters escape themselves. A complete last statement may end at EOF without a semicolon. An unterminated quote/comment produces an error and is not executed. No backslash SQL string-escape mode is implied.

The engine is single-threaded and single-process. The data file is locked against a second writer. EOF/destruction rolls back any active transaction. A successful commit response is emitted only after durable commit returns.

## Output on stdout

- Non-query success: OK<TAB>affected_rows
- Query header: RESULT<TAB>column_name...
- Each query row: ROW<TAB>typed_value...
- Successful query completion: END<TAB>row_count
- Statement failure: ERROR<TAB>category<TAB>message

Categories are internal diagnostics, not MySQL error numbers. Output flushes after every completed statement/error. A result is valid only after END; if a streaming query fails, ERROR invalidates any rows already emitted for that result. Consumers must drain row output while queries are running.

Cells use i: for signed integers, s: for text, v:[...] for float32 vectors, and d: for double-precision distances. Text, names and messages escape backslash, tab, LF, CR and NUL as \\, \t, \n, \r and \0. Other UTF-8 bytes are preserved. Floats use enough decimal digits to round trip.

Exit status: 0 for an error-free session, 1 if any SQL/framing error occurred, 2 for command-line/startup/fatal transport errors. SQL errors do not end the input session. Diagnostics for fatal errors go to stderr.

## Example

Input:

    CREATE TABLE items (id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, label VARCHAR(30), v VECTOR(2));
    INSERT INTO items VALUES (1,'first',[0,0]),(2,'second',[3,4]);
    SELECT id,L2_DISTANCE(v,[0,0]) AS distance FROM items ORDER BY distance LIMIT 1;

Expected output (tabs shown as spaces):

    OK  0
    OK  2
    RESULT  id  distance
    ROW  i:1  d:0
    END  1

The dev-tsv contract is for local development only. Official clients must use JSONL.
## Default official JSONL adapter

Launch `minivectordb --data-dir /data` (or explicitly `--protocol jsonl`). Recovery and file opening finish before the exact `{"type":"ready"}` handshake is flushed. Each UTF-8 physical line is one JSON request, with a 16 MiB request limit and nesting limit 64. Duplicate object keys, malformed numbers, invalid UTF-8 and unpaired Unicode surrogates are rejected. Invalid framing returns an error with null ID when no unambiguous validated ID can be recovered.

Execute requests contain `id`, `op:"execute"`, `sql`, and optional `search_mode:"exact"|"ann"` (default exact). The mode reaches the database API. IDs retain their original JSON type and number lexeme; BIGINT results use exact decimal integers. Query output has columns and two-dimensional rows; vectors are arrays with finite numbers. The current SQL engine does not implement NULL values, so no NULL cell is produced.

Successful nonqueries include integer affected_rows; DDL and transaction controls use zero. SQL failures return boolean ok:false and a nonempty internal error category; no unpublished official error-code mapping is assumed. A failed statement does not terminate the JSONL session or change its normal exit status.

Responses are completed before any stdout output. A 64 KiB buffer handles small responses; larger ones spill to a uniquely created anonymous file under the data directory, streamed back in 64 KiB chunks. Unlinking immediately after opening lets the OS reclaim the spool on both normal close and process death. SELECT execution/spool failures therefore produce one error instead of partial success. An output transport failure after emission begins is fatal, without emitting a second response. Result size is not held in memory as a single string.

Shutdown explicitly rolls back an active transaction and releases the database before returning exactly id and ok:true, then exits zero. EOF also rolls back. Every protocol message ends with a newline and is flushed. Logs and fatal diagnostics use stderr. CLI/startup/transport failures exit 2.
